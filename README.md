# jRust ![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/jrust.svg)

*What is this madness?*

This, my friends, is a Rust macro that parses Java-like syntax and runs it as a Rust program.

**Warning: Very early release.** I just wanted to get a prototype working so I
could reserve the name on crates.io.  Of course I'll work more on this very
useful program later.

## Why

**"Science isn't about WHY, it's about WHY NOT? WHY is so much of our science
dangerous, WHY NOT marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not
invent a special safety door that won't kick you on the butt on the way out
because *you are fired*."**
